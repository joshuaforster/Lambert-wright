We were instantly impressed with the professional nature in which they approached our requests and linked us in with an excellent kitchen designer. Once the build was under way we were very happy with the quality of workmen they employed along with the nature in which they tackled and solved our changes and the unforeseen problems which surfaced. The final result is a high quality kitchen finished to the best standards.",

We have been very happy with the quality of work. We had a clear schedule of works and despite the challenges of Covid this was adhered to. All the tradespeople were of a high quality, a pleasure to work with, and were always responsive to our input. Jason managed the project closely and is focused on ensuring work is undertaken to a high standard with a clear attention to detail. From start to finish the build went smoothly. We would happily recommend Lambert & Wright.",

We have recently had a new heating system and boiler installed by Jason and his team and we were very pleased with the initial advice on both the correct remedial work for our old system and the best products to use. We are extremely happy with the installation and quality of workmanship. Jason took the time to explain in detail the new system and how it works and the aftercare service has been fantastic.",

    text: "We have recently engaged Jason to install a new family bathroom into our house. From our first meeting, Jason’s extensive knowledge of bathrooms, kitchens and central heating systems impressed us. Jason introduced us to Joanne from Bathrooms by Regency in Wigston, who patiently assisted us in making choices with regard to all the necessary sanitary ware and fittings. Jason also coordinated all the necessary associated trade’s people, which helped enormously to expedite the process. The final result has been a completely modernised, functional and aesthetically pleasing bathroom with a superb quality of finishing. We would have no hesitation in recommending Jason and look forward to him returning shortly to overhaul our Central Heating Systems and re-fit our ensuite bathroom.",

    text: "We met Larry Lambert late in 2011, and quickly felt we wanted him to take on our project of converting a derelict grade II listed barn into a wonderful living space for guests. Larry makes you feel that nothing is impossible and will hold your hand on all aspects of the build. Having never built anything before, Larry gave us the confidence that the work would be done properly and professionally. I would say Larry cares about the project just as much as the client does. He wants to put his name to quality work. We would have no hesitation in recommending Larry and his building firm to future clients, in fact we have already done so.",

    text: "Last year I moved into a small, detached house which almost suited my needs, except that there was a very small kitchen and no dining room. However, Larry saw the potential to improve this situation by knocking through from the kitchen into the adjacent passage and into the integral garage, to make a large kitchen/dining room. I contacted Larry to discuss the possibilities of this conversion, which Larry and his team undertook for me, and they made a fantastic job of it! The conditions were not easy as it was winter, but they were considerate and careful of every aspect, including leaving the area tidy and clean as possible at the end of each day. Larry dealt with every aspect of building regulations, electricians, plumbers, safety checks etc. and were always thoroughly professional. I would highly recommend them for their attention to detail and ability to come up with excellent ideas and suggestions to enhance the finish of their work.",

I am pleased to say that the whole process from initial discussion, design, estimating and ordering of materials through to installing, decorating, and completing these rooms was carried out in the most professional manner. I and my partner are delighted with the end result. Throughout the process, Larry consulted us whenever there was an unexpected circumstance (as there inevitably is on such works) and were always pro-active and reasonable in helping us to arrive at the right solutions. They completed the work on time and on budget and I would not hesitate to recommend them to friends and family or to use their services again.",
