      <section className="mb-6">
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">7. Providing the services</h2>
        <p className="mb-2">7.1 We will supply the services to you from the date agreed in writing until we have completed the services. The estimated completion date for the services is as told to you during the quotation process. This date is an estimate only and we will not be liable for any failure to complete the services by the agreed date.</p>
        <p className="mb-2">7.2 We are not responsible for delays outside our control. If our performance of the services is affected by an event outside our control, then we will contact you as soon as possible to let you know and we will take steps to minimise the effect of the delay. Provided we do this, we will not be liable for delays caused by the event, but if there is a risk of substantial delay, you may contact us to end the contract and receive a refund for any services you have paid for but not received.</p>
        <p className="mb-2">7.3 If you have asked us to provide the services to you at your property and you do not allow us access to your property as arranged (and you do not have a good reason for this), we may charge you additional costs incurred by us as a result. If, despite our reasonable efforts, we are unable to contact you or re-arrange access to your property, we may end the contract and clause 8.3 will apply.</p>
        <p className="mb-2">7.4 We may need certain information from you so that we can provide the services to you. We will contact you to ask for this information. If you do not, within a reasonable time of our request, provide us with this information, or you provide us with incomplete or incorrect information, we may either end the contract (see clause 9.1) or make an additional charge of a reasonable sum to compensate us for any extra work that is required as a result. We will not be responsible for providing the services late or not providing any part of them if this is caused by your failure to provide information within a reasonable time.</p>
        <p className="mb-2">7.5 Suspension of Services: We may have to suspend the services to:</p>
        <p className="ml-4 mb-2">(a) deal with technical problems or make minor technical changes;</p>
        <p className="ml-4 mb-2">(b) update the services to reflect changes in relevant laws and regulatory requirements;</p>
        <p className="ml-4 mb-2">(c) make changes to the services as requested by you or notified by us to you (see clause 5).</p>
        <p className="mb-2">7.6 We will contact you in advance to tell you we will be suspending the services, unless the problem is urgent or an emergency. You may contact us to end the contract if we suspend the services for a period of more than 3 months and we will refund any sums you have paid in advance for services not provided to you.</p>
        <p className="mb-2">7.7 We may also suspend the services if you do not pay. If you do not pay us for the services when you are supposed to (see clause 11.3) and you still do not make payment within 5 days of us reminding you that payment is due, we may suspend supply of services until you have paid us the outstanding amounts. We will contact you to tell you we are suspending supply of the services. As well as suspending the services, we can also charge you interest on your overdue payments (see clause 11.4).</p>

        <p className="mb-2">8.2 If you are ending the contract for a reason set out at (a) to (e) below, the contract will end immediately and we will refund you in full for any services which have not yet been provided or have not been properly provided, less any costs incurred by us in preparing services.

        <p className="ml-4 mb-2">(b) we have told you about an error in the price or description of the services and you do not wish to proceed;</p>
        <p className="ml-4 mb-2">(c) there is a risk the services may be significantly delayed because of events outside our control;</p>
        <p className="ml-4 mb-2">(d) we suspend the services for technical reasons for a period of more than 3 months; or</p>
        <p className="ml-4 mb-2">(e) you have a legal right to end the contract because we are in breach of this contract.</p>
        <p className="mb-2">8.3 If you terminate the contract for any reason other than those set out above, the contract will end immediately but we may charge you reasonable compensation for the net costs we will incur as a result of your ending the contract.</p>

        <p className="ml-4 mb-2">(b) you do not, within a reasonable time, provide us with information that has been requested and is necessary for us to provide the services;</p>
        <p className="ml-4 mb-2">(c) you do not give us access to your property to enable us to provide the services to you.</p>
        <p className="mb-2">9.2 If we end the contract in the situations set out in clause 9.1, we will refund any money you have paid in advance for services we have not provided but we may deduct or charge you reasonable compensation for the net costs we will incur as a result of you breaking the contract.</p>
        <p className="mb-2">9.3 If we terminate the services for any other reason, we will let you know in writing at least 5 days in advance of our stopping the services and will refund any sums you have paid in advance for services which will not be provided.</p>

        <p className="mb-2">10.2 We offer the following goodwill guarantee which is in addition to your legal rights and does not affect them. In the unlikely event there is any defect with the services:</p>
        <p className="ml-4 mb-2">(a) if remedying the defect is impossible or cannot be done within a reasonable time or without significant inconvenience to you, we will refund the price you have paid for the element of the services which is defective.</p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">11. Price and payment</h2>
        <p className="mb-2">11.1 The price of the services (which includes VAT) will be the price set out in the quotation. We take all reasonable care to ensure that the prices of services advised to you are correct, however, we may need to amend prices if the price of any goods or services purchased from a third party is increased during the term of the contract.</p>
        <p className="mb-2">11.2 We will pass on changes in the rate of VAT. If the rate of VAT changes between your quotation date and the date we provide the services, we will adjust the rate of VAT that you pay, unless you have already paid for the services in full before the change in the rate of VAT takes effect.</p>
        <p className="mb-2">11.3 The payment schedule shall be as follows:</p>
        <p className="ml-4 mb-2">(a) First payment – 20% non-refundable deposit of the quotation (as referred to in clause 3.1) cost followed by stage payments which will be invoiced fortnightly until final completion of services.</p>
        <p className="ml-4 mb-2">(b) Only on receipt of payment of final invoice will we hand over all relative certificates including: Operational Manuals, NIC Electrical Certificate, Gas Safe Certificate, and Local Authority Building Control Certificate.</p>
        <p className="mb-2">11.4 We can charge interest if you pay late. If you do not make any payment to us by the due date (see clause 11.3) we may charge interest to you on the overdue amount at the rate of 3% a year above the base lending rate of the Bank of England from time to time. This interest shall accrue on a daily basis from the due date until the date of actual payment of the overdue amount, whether before or after judgment. You must pay us interest together with any overdue amount.</p>
        <p className="mb-2">11.5 If you think an invoice is wrong, please contact us promptly to let us know. You will not have to pay any interest until the dispute is resolved. Once the dispute is resolved, we will charge you interest on correctly invoiced sums from the original due date.</p>

        <p className="mb-2">12.1 We are responsible to you for foreseeable loss and damage caused by us. If we fail to comply with these terms, we are responsible for loss or damage you suffer that is a foreseeable result of our breaking this contract or our failing to use reasonable care and skill. Loss or damage is foreseeable if either it is obvious that it will happen or if, at the time the contract was made, both we and you knew it might happen, for example, if you discussed it with us during the sales process. Our liability for any loss or damage is limited to repairing goods or reperforming the services. Where this is not possible or we are not able to repair goods or reperform services within a reasonable time, our liability shall be limited to refunding the cost of the defective goods or services.</p>
        <p className="mb-2">12.2 We do not exclude or limit in any way our liability to you where it would be unlawful to do so. This includes liability for death or personal injury caused by our negligence or the negligence of our employees, agents or subcontractors; for fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation; for breach of your legal rights in relation to the services.</p>
        <p className="mb-2">12.3 If we are providing services in your property, we will make good any damage to your property caused by us while doing so, except as specifically excluded in the quotation. However, we are not responsible for the cost of repairing any pre-existing faults or damage to your property that we discover while providing the services. Our liability in this respect is capped in accordance with our public liability insurance which is capped at £2,000,000.</p>
        <p className="mb-2">12.4 We are not liable for business losses. We only supply the services for domestic and private use.

        <p className="ml-4 mb-2">(c) if you agreed to this during the quotation process, to inform you about similar products that we provide, but you may stop receiving these communications at any time by contacting us.</p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">14. Other important terms</h2>
        <p className="mb-2">14.1 We may transfer our rights and obligations under these terms to another organisation. We will contact you to let you know if we plan to do this. If you are unhappy with the transfer you may contact us to end the contract within one week of us telling you about it and we will refund you any payments you have made in advance for services not provided.</p>
        <p className="mb-2">14.2 You may only transfer your rights or your obligations under these terms to another person with our written consent.</p>
        <p className="mb-2">14.3 This contract is between you and us. No other person shall have any rights to enforce any of its terms.</p>
        <p className="mb-2">14.4 If any court or relevant authority decides that any part of these conditions is unlawful, the remaining paragraphs will remain in full force and effect.</p>
        <p className="mb-2">14.5 Even if we delay in enforcing this contract, we can still enforce it later. If we do not insist immediately that you do anything you are required to do under these terms, or if we delay in taking steps against you in respect of your breaking this contract, that will not mean that you do not have to do those things or prevent us from taking steps against you at a later date. For example, if you miss a payment and we do not chase you but we continue to provide the services, we can still require you to make the payment at a later date.</p>
        <p className="mb-2">14.6 These terms are governed by English law and you can bring legal proceedings in respect of the services in the English courts.</p>
